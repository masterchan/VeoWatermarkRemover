This is a **demo/preview build** of the upcoming Veo watermark removal feature for [GeminiWatermarkTool](https://github.com/allenk/GeminiWatermarkTool). Once stabilized, this functionality will be merged into the main GWT release with full GUI support.

Remove the "Veo" text watermark from Google Veo-generated videos using **mathematically precise reverse alpha blending** — the same proven technique behind [GeminiWatermarkTool](https://github.com/allenk/GeminiWatermarkTool).

No cloud services. No AI hallucination. No quality loss. Just math.

## What's New (v0.6.2)

- **Auto-detects the relocated watermark.** Newer Veo portrait outputs
  (1080×1920, 720×1280) moved the diamond further in from the corner,
  and v0.6.1 didn't recognise the new spot — it SKIPped those files
  ([#14](https://github.com/allenk/VeoWatermarkRemover/issues/14),
  [#16](https://github.com/allenk/VeoWatermarkRemover/issues/16)).
  v0.6.2 adds the new positions AND a **smart bottom-right search** that
  finds the diamond wherever it sits (matching its shape across several
  frames and requiring them to agree on the position). If the position
  shifts again, the tool locates it **without needing an update** — the
  fixed positions are just a fast path, the search is the safety net.
- **Fixes the "dark hole" over-removal on bright backgrounds.** When the
  watermark drifted across a lit hand, skin, or a bright sky, the
  per-frame estimator could over-shoot and over-subtract, leaving a dark
  crater for a run of frames. v0.6.2 anchors each frame's intensity to
  the stable per-shot value and rejects physically-implausible
  estimates, so removal stays clean across the whole clip even as the
  background changes.
- **Keeps partially-occluded frames** ([#5](https://github.com/allenk/VeoWatermarkRemover/issues/5)).
  When a foreground object partly covers the diamond, the watermark is
  still there underneath — but v0.6.1 could read the low match score as
  "no watermark" and skip those frames, leaving it visible. v0.6.2 adds
  a three-tier confidence gate: high-confidence frames are tuned per
  frame, low-confidence frames get the shot's consensus intensity
  applied instead of being skipped, and only genuinely watermark-free
  frames pass through untouched.
- **Smarter 1080p intensity** ([#2](https://github.com/allenk/VeoWatermarkRemover/issues/2)).
  1080p previously used a fixed intensity, but some clips need a
  noticeably stronger one. v0.6.2 measures the correct intensity per
  shot with a more accurate least-squares estimator (~20% closer to the
  ideal value), while staying flicker-free on 1080p by locking one value
  for the whole shot.

> **Coming next — ML-assisted intensity.** Picking the right removal
> intensity per clip is the single biggest quality factor. v0.6.2
> estimates it analytically; the next release will add a small neural
> model — trained and run entirely on your machine — that predicts the
> optimal intensity straight from the frame, automatically handling the
> hardest clips (dark, low-contrast, or busy backgrounds). Still fully
> offline, no upload, deterministic reverse-alpha math at the core.

## Previous Release Highlights (v0.6.1)

- **Survives intro fade-ins.** Many community-supplied 720p clips
  start with a brief fade-in or splash where the watermark isn't yet
  composited, and v0.6.0 saw NCC = 0 on frame 0 and SKIPped the whole
  file. v0.6.1 probes 12 frames spread across the video's first 90%
  and picks the best (sample, tuple) pair, so fade-ins no longer
  cause a false SKIP. Five previously-skipped community samples now
  auto-detect cleanly.
- **Adaptive per-frame alpha refinement.** The new
  [bisection feedback loop](#how-it-handles-difficult-clips) doesn't
  just estimate the alpha intensity — it APPLIES the candidate value,
  evaluates whether the result looks like the surrounding background,
  and adjusts up (residue remained) or down (dark hole) for up to
  five rounds per frame. Visual-consistency goal rather than pure
  prediction, so clips with foreground motion or heterogeneous
  backgrounds get a per-frame scale that actually fits.
- **Per-shot seed + per-frame change cap.** A stable per-video
  baseline (median of 12 sample-frame estimates) anchors the
  bisection, and a small per-frame change cap (±0.05) prevents any
  single bad assessment from causing a visible flash. Output stays
  smooth even on content where the bisection metric is locally noisy.
- **`--variant 720p-1` / `--variant 720p-2` escape hatch in the
  SKIP hint.** When auto-detect can't lock on, the SKIP message
  now suggests the manual override flags directly. Useful for clips
  that auto fails on (rare with v0.6.1's multi-frame probe, but the
  escape hatch is documented).
- **Honest limit acknowledged.** Some clips with very strong
  per-frame content motion (medical illustrations with hair strands,
  rapid-cut animation, etc.) still produce a small residue on a few
  frames. See
  [Manual touch-up workflow](#manual-touch-up-workflow-for-difficult-clips)
  below for the recommended workflow when the automatic result isn't
  good enough.

## Previous Release Highlights (v0.6.0)

- **720p Gemini 3.5 diamond removal — now auto-detected.** Both
  geometries observed in real Veo 720p outputs are calibrated:
  720p-1 standard (48×48 at margin 72,72, ~1.5 Mbps tier) and
  720p-2 compact (44×44 at margin 29,40, ~7 Mbps tier). Auto-detect
  picks the right one via NCC scoring.
- **Dynamic per-frame alpha estimation.** First release with
  per-frame alpha intensity recovery instead of a static multiplier.
  v0.6.1 evolved this into the adaptive bisection above.
- **Position refinement at video startup.** A ±4 px local NCC
  search around the tuple anchor snaps to the actual diamond
  position, absorbing encoding-tier drift without recalibration.
- **Transcoder timing fidelity.** Output frame count, duration, and
  FPS metadata match input exactly — no more silently dropping tail
  frames or shifting duration. Three classic libavcodec API misuses
  (decoder flush, packet duration stamping, frame-rate metadata
  propagation) fixed in one go.
- **Quieter default output** — FFmpeg container parser warnings
  (e.g. the `Unknown cover type: 0x1` line emitted on C2PA-tagged
  Veo videos) suppressed at default verbosity.

### Help Wanted: Other Resolutions

If you have a Gemini 3.5 video at **4K**, **square 1:1**, **9:16
short-form**, or any resolution not in 1080p / 720p, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/allenk/VeoWatermarkRemover/issues)
with a sample so we can calibrate that size too. The diamond shape
is consistent across resolutions; we mainly need the position and
size for each new encoding profile.

## Previous Release Highlights (v0.5.0)

- **Gemini 3.5 diamond watermark removal (1080p)** — the first
  release to handle Gemini 3.5's new diamond watermark by default
  (no flag needed). 1920×1080 landscape and 1080×1920 portrait
  validated end-to-end against community samples
  ([issue #2](https://github.com/allenk/VeoWatermarkRemover/issues/2),
  [#3](https://github.com/allenk/VeoWatermarkRemover/issues/3)).
- **`--legacy` flag for older Veo videos** — videos generated before
  Gemini 3.5 (with the "Veo" text watermark) need `--legacy`;
  the diamond and the text are different shapes at different
  positions, so applying the wrong removal would damage the frame.
- **No fallback between profiles** — if a diamond-mode result still
  shows the old "Veo" text, the video is pre-Gemini-3.5 — re-run
  with `--legacy`.
- **Tighter encode** — CRF 14 / preset slow (was 18 / medium). PSNR
  improved by ~2-3 dB on encoding-only regions; visually identical
  to source on most content.

## Previous Release Highlights (v0.4.0)

- **macOS stability fix** — addresses the SIGBUS crash on Apple Silicon reported in upstream GeminiWatermarkTool [#30](https://github.com/allenk/GeminiWatermarkTool/issues/30) / [#31](https://github.com/allenk/GeminiWatermarkTool/issues/31). The Vulkan loader is probed before NCNN's GPU init; if it's absent (the default on macOS without MoltenVK), AI denoise transparently falls back to CPU instead of crashing
- **`--snap-min-size`** — finer snap-search control on the image-watermark side (default 16, range 8-64), mirroring the existing `--snap-max-size` flag
- **End-to-end CI smoke test** — every CI build now runs `--denoise ai` through a real inference pipeline (Windows / Linux / macOS) before publishing. The previous `--version`-only check never touched the AI denoise init path, which is how the macOS crash slipped past CI in v0.3.0

## Previous Release Highlights (v0.3.0)

- **Improved watermark masks** — remastered 720p and 1080p alpha maps using golden frame-differencing from multiple video sources (10+ transition pairs)
- **Better output quality** — upgraded video encoder (High profile, B-frames, multi-reference)
- **Enhanced AI cleanup** — tuned per-resolution denoise parameters with expanded inference context
- **Progress bar** — real-time ASCII progress indicator during video processing
- **Quieter output** — reduced log verbosity in normal mode; use `--verbose` for detailed diagnostics

## How It Works

![Drag & Drop Demo](artworks/veo-watermark-remover.gif)

**Just drag and drop.** Drop your Veo video onto the executable — it automatically removes the watermark and outputs `video_processed.mp4` with audio preserved.

### Before / After

![Side by Side Comparison](artworks/GWT_VEO_Watermark_Removal_Demo.gif)

## Quick Start

### Drag & Drop (Windows — Easiest)

1. Download `GeminiWatermarkTool-Video.exe` (see [Download](#download) below)
2. Drag your `.mp4` file onto the exe
3. Done — output appears as `yourfile_processed.mp4` in the same folder

### Command Line (All Platforms)

```bash
# Simplest — Gemini 3.5 diamond removal (default mode, 1080p + 720p auto-detected)
./GeminiWatermarkTool-Video video.mp4

# Pre-Gemini-3.5 video with the old "Veo" text watermark
./GeminiWatermarkTool-Video --legacy old_veo_video.mp4

# Specify output path
./GeminiWatermarkTool-Video -i video.mp4 -o cleaned.mp4

# Pre-3.5 with explicit input / output
./GeminiWatermarkTool-Video --legacy -i old_video.mp4 -o cleaned.mp4

# Force a specific 720p variant if auto-detect picks wrong (rare):
./GeminiWatermarkTool-Video --variant 720p-1 video.mp4   # 48x48 standard
./GeminiWatermarkTool-Video --variant 720p-2 video.mp4   # 44x44 compact
```

> **Which mode do I need?**
>
> - Videos **generated by Gemini 3.5 or later** carry the **diamond logo**
>   in the bottom-right corner → use **default mode** (no flag).
> - Videos generated **before Gemini 3.5** carry the **"Veo" text** in
>   the bottom-right corner → use **`--legacy`**.
> - Some mixed-vintage portrait outputs carry **both** watermarks.
>   Run default first, then `--legacy` on the output. There is **no
>   automatic fallback** between the two modes — applying the wrong
>   one at the wrong position would damage the frame, so you have to
>   pick.

## How It Handles Difficult Clips

The v0.6.1 adaptive loop runs once per frame and behaves like a small
auto-tuner. For each frame:

1. Compute the per-frame NCC against the calibrated diamond template.
   If NCC is below the gate (heavy foreground occlusion), the frame
   is left untouched — leaving the diamond visible on those few
   frames is more honest than scribbling synthetic content over them.
2. Sample the local background ring around the watermark region.
3. Pick a candidate alpha intensity (starting from the per-shot
   seed value learned from the first 12 sample frames).
4. APPLY the candidate, measure whether the resulting region matches
   the surrounding background:
   - **Brighter than surroundings → residue still present →
     increase intensity.**
   - **Darker than surroundings → over-subtracted (dark hole) →
     decrease intensity.**
5. Up to 5 bisection rounds. The change between adjacent frames is
   capped at ±0.05 so any single bad assessment can't cause a
   visible flash.

The goal is **visual consistency with the local context**, not a
prediction of some "true" alpha value. Same content + same diamond →
same removal. Different scenes within a clip get different per-frame
intensities, but each is correct for its own surroundings.

## Manual Touch-Up Workflow for Difficult Clips

The automatic pipeline handles **most** Gemini 3.5 video samples
cleanly, but some content classes still resist a fully automatic
solution — heavy per-frame motion, foreground objects overlapping
the watermark region, medical-illustration backgrounds with
high-frequency detail next to the diamond, etc. If you run a video
through v0.6.1 and a small number of frames still show residue or
a faint outline, the practical workflow is:

```bash
# 1. Run the automatic pipeline first
GeminiWatermarkTool-Video video.mp4

# 2. Decompose the auto-processed output into individual frames
ffmpeg -i video_processed.mp4 frames/frame_%04d.png

# 3. Open GUI mode (image-side GeminiWatermarkTool) on the problem
#    frames only. Use Custom region mode and tune the Alpha intensity
#    slider until that frame looks clean. Save the touched-up PNG
#    back to the same path.
#    (See https://github.com/allenk/GeminiWatermarkTool for the GUI
#    build that ships the Alpha intensity slider in Custom mode.)

# 4. Re-encode the frames back into a video, copying audio from the
#    original
ffmpeg -framerate 24 -i frames/frame_%04d.png \
       -i video.mp4 -map 0:v -map 1:a \
       -c:v libx264 -crf 14 -preset slow -pix_fmt yuv420p \
       -c:a copy \
       video_touched_up.mp4
```

For most clips you'll only need to manually fix a handful of frames.
The GUI's Custom-mode Alpha intensity slider lets you dial in the
exact value visually; values around `0.55-0.70` (V1-relative) cover
most current Gemini 3.5 720p content.

### Sigma Tuning Tips

The default AI denoise sigma is tuned for photographic / video
content (sigma = 50 for 1080p, sigma = 20 for 720p Veo). If your
output looks too blurry or has slight unnatural artifacts on
illustration / animation content, try a **smaller sigma**:

```bash
# Anime / illustration content often looks best with sigma ~15
GeminiWatermarkTool-Video --sigma 15 video.mp4

# Photographic content where AI denoise is too aggressive
GeminiWatermarkTool-Video --sigma 25 video.mp4
```

Lower sigma = less smoothing = sharper output but residual H.264
ringing artifacts may stay visible near the WM edges. Higher sigma
= more smoothing = cleaner edges but slight loss of detail. The
defaults are a compromise; for content classes with distinct
aesthetics, manual tuning helps.

## Features

- **Single executable** — standalone, zero dependencies, zero installation
- **Cross-platform** — Windows, Linux, and macOS (Universal Binary)
- **Direct mp4-to-mp4** — no intermediate files, no external tools needed
- **Audio preserved** — original audio track is kept without re-encoding
- **AI denoise** — GPU-accelerated FDnCNN cleanup for residual artifacts (Vulkan)
- **Gemini 3.5 diamond removal** (default, v0.5.0+) — handles the new
  watermark layout out of the box; v0.6.0 adds 720p (both standard
  and compact variants) alongside 1080p
- **Relocated-watermark auto-detection** (v0.6.2+) — known positions
  plus a smart bottom-right search that finds the diamond wherever it
  moves, with cross-frame agreement to avoid false matches
- **Over-removal protection** (v0.6.2+) — per-frame intensity is
  anchored to the stable per-shot value, preventing the dark-hole
  artifact when the watermark crosses bright/low-contrast areas
- **Partial-occlusion handling** (v0.6.2+) — a three-tier confidence
  gate cleans frames where a foreground object partly covers the
  diamond instead of skipping them
- **Dynamic 1080p intensity** (v0.6.2+) — least-squares per-shot
  estimate replaces the old fixed multiplier, flicker-free
- **Adaptive per-frame alpha refinement** (v0.6.1+, 720p) — bisection
  feedback loop applies a candidate intensity, measures the result
  against the local background, and adjusts up/down per frame; the
  change between adjacent frames is capped to prevent visible
  flashes
- **Multi-frame detection probe** (v0.6.1+) — probes 12 frames
  across the video instead of just frame 0, so intro fade-ins no
  longer cause a false SKIP
- **Tick-exact transcoder timing** (v0.6.0+) — frame count,
  duration, and FPS metadata match input exactly; no drift in NLE /
  editor alignment
- **`--variant` escape hatch** — force a known 720p geometry if
  auto-detect can't lock on (very rare with v0.6.1)
- **`--sigma` for content-aware denoise** — lower for animation /
  illustration, higher for photographic content
- **Legacy "Veo" text removal** (`--legacy`) — for pre-Gemini-3.5
  videos; the previous default behaviour still available behind a
  single flag
- **Progress bar** — real-time processing progress in the terminal

## Technical Details

This tool uses the same **reverse alpha blending** algorithm as [GeminiWatermarkTool](https://github.com/allenk/GeminiWatermarkTool):

```text
original = (watermarked - alpha * logo_value) / (1 - alpha)
```

The Veo watermark alpha maps were extracted using frame differencing from Veo-generated videos with watermark on/off transitions. Multiple golden pairs (Lightning flash, Light bulb, Sunrise scenes) were averaged for maximum accuracy. AI denoise (FDnCNN, NCNN + Vulkan GPU) handles residual edge artifacts from video compression.

For the full technical background on reverse alpha blending, see:

## System Requirements

| Component | Requirement                                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OS        | Windows 10/11 x64, Linux x64, macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon)         |
| GPU       | Vulkan-capable GPU for AI Denoise acceleration (or fallback to CPU) |
| RAM       | 4 GB minimum                                                        |

> **Note:** AI denoise prefers a Vulkan GPU but transparently falls back to CPU when no Vulkan loader is available.
>
> **macOS users:** macOS does not ship Vulkan natively — install the [LunarG Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) (which bundles MoltenVK) for GPU acceleration. Otherwise the tool runs in CPU mode by default; this is fully supported but slower than Vulkan inference.

## Demo Build Notice

This is a **preview/demo build** with the following limitations:

- **CLI only** — GUI support is planned for the main GWT release
- **Video only** — this build processes video files (.mp4/.mkv/.mov); for Gemini image watermarks, use the main [GeminiWatermarkTool](https://github.com/allenk/GeminiWatermarkTool)

### What's Next

When the Veo feature is stable, it will be merged into [GeminiWatermarkTool](https://github.com/allenk/GeminiWatermarkTool) as a unified release supporting both Gemini image and Veo video watermark removal.

## About GeminiWatermarkTool
